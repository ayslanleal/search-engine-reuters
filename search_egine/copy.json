[{"title": "ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT", "body": "  Mounting trade friction between the  U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting  nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic  damage, businessmen and officials said.      They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.  Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the  U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.      But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt  them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be  their gain.      The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on  imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not  to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.      Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs  at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms  said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the  new taxes.      \"We wouldn't be able to do business,\" said a spokesman for  leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric  Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.      \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time  beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of  exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said Tom  Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James  Capel and Co>.      In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.      \"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against  Japan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a senior  Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.      Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last  year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.      The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves  to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.      \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and  cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we  want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" said  Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.      A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion  association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan  might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports  are similar to those of Japan.      Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion  dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.      In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough  curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of  semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the  U.S.      In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been  selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics  manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such  a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by  further U.S. Pressure to block imports.      \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills,  director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.      \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will  be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong  is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said.      The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,  accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.      The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade  talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,  Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.      \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two  countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very  serious matter,\" Button said.      He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,  Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant  U.S. Exports to that country.      Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the  trade stand-off continue.      Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined  a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.      The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget  and record public works spending in the first half of the  financial year.      They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency  measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.      Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto  Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and  Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an  effort to end the dispute.

MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy  supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600  mln, they said.      The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in  Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen  and a decline in domestic electric power demand.      MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand  outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the  Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.      They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy  supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.      Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power  in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27  pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and  liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.

It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht  from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials  and semi-finished products.      The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the  first quarter due to lower oil prices.      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6  billion baht from 56.6 billion.      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up  64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.  "}, {"title": "INDONESIA SEES CPO PRICE RISING SHARPLY", "body": "  Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO)  prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB  sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall  in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree  crops, told Indonesian reporters.      Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332  dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.      Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite  making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it  could possibly increase its international market share.      Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil  after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure  supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.      Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary  shortage than to lose export markets.      Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500  tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank  figures.

The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented  the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.      The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration  Commission today.      Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the  ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.      The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week  of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to  protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.      The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to  be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of  each shift and then to walk off.      Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with  container movements most affected, but has not stopped  altogether, they said.      They said they could not say how long the disruption will  go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.

He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in  palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.      Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil  may also be introduced. But he said the question was still  being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no  decision on when to go ahead had been made.      The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber  physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.      \"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said.  \"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a  mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\"      Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee  added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to  five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are  traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,  exchange officials said.      The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the  introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one  official said a feasibility study was needed first. No  decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April  23, traders said.      Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the  world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should  expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of  the exchange would help this.      Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost  overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.      He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to  encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would  also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to  encourage participation.      Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start  although trading in coffee has been disappointing.      Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in  April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9  mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered  locally, the latest exchange report said.       Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905  tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.       Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and  44 traders.

"}, {"title": "SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER", "body": "  Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to  lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of  its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.      Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9  trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank  with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in  October.      But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu  told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its  position.      \"We'll be back in position in first place within three  years,\" Komatsu said in an interview.      He said that while the merger will initially reduce  Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand  Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where  it has been relatively weak.      But financial analysts are divided on whether and how  quickly the gamble will pay off.      Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in  view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch  network from scratch.      The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the  wisdom of some of those moves.      \"They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now  it's largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd  financial analyst Simon Smithson.      Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.      \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.      But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.      \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,  we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three  years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.      Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes  into the securities business at home.      Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial  from investment banking.      But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu  said he hopes further deregulation will create new  opportunities.      \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust  bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.\"      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such  domestic securities business as profitable government bond  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.      \"We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed  in two or three years,\" he said.      Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.      The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.      \"It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said  Kleinwort's Smithson.      \"After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling  around. It will be the next decade before we see if the  strategy is right or wrong.\"  "}, {"title": "SUBROTO SAYS INDONESIA SUPPORTS TIN PACT EXTENSION", "body": "  Mines and Energy Minister Subroto  confirmed Indonesian support for an extension of the sixth  International Tin Agreement (ITA), but said a new pact was not  necessary.

Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,  will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy  back securities pledged on May 6.      Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as  an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively  withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with  today's allocation.      A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the  withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit  policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful  liquidity in the banking system.      Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank  over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely  April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.      The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2  billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks  themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.      Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much  liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the  effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main  open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two  further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.      The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6  and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that  range are possible, dealers said.

It reported a  net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986,  compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.      The company said it had been able to cut its losses because  its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu  started in the second half of 1986.      Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition  by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their  restructuring into a gold loan.      A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in  October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of  275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.

Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.  Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open  its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to  protect local farmers.      Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat  exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.  End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to  visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask  Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and  remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.      Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market  share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year  beef accord next March 31.      Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales  from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.      U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its  beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain  imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.      An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.  Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing  some one billion dlrs in new business.      The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.      To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.

He told a press conference the government planned to  increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market  to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold  the surplus \"at a proper level.\"      But he said the government would not allow the won to  appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has  been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.      The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with  the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3  billion dlrs in 1985.      Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects  were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government  would try to hold the current account surplus to around five  billion dlrs a year for the next five years.      \"Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five  billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in  exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now  the surplus is growing faster than we expected,\" he said.      Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35  pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this  year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.      Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a  surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr  deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the  country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first  time.      South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs  in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest  in Asia.      \"This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the  major constraints on our development... Last year was a major  turning point for the Korean economy,\" Kim said.      Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of  foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from  about 50 pct in 1986.      \"The government, however, does not want to accelerate  reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,\" he  said.      Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation  and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,  particularly the United States.      \"We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but  we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a  proper level,\" Kim said.

The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada  Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line  Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.      The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials  availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the  important capital and operating advantages gained by locating  on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.      The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant  producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer  that can replace tetra ethyl lead.      Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States  where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of  health concerns, the statement added.      Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the  U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in  Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,  it said.      Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five  billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a  major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.      The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on  stream in late 1989, the statement said.

Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told  Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries  operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for  investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic  slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.      Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in  Norway since 1985.

Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but  Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned  liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a  steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.

"}, {"title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING", "body": "  Australian markets are booming as foreign  fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and  other traditional markets, analysts said.      High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and  an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of  fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and  U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.      Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in  and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they  diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.      A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in  the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the  currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.      Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital  are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily  inquiries from Japan and the United States.      \"These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about  and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending  up here with the attraction of high interest rates and  reasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd  economist Brian Hamley said.      \"There is a 'flight to quality',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may  not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too  many other countries where you'd want to put your money.\"      The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting  investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against  the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.      \"We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.  Where some people would be concerned about the value of the  U.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose  said. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap  and the currency looks stable?\"      But turning that capital into more permanent productive  investment depends on government economic policy, he said.      \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the  direction in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore  investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough  economic statement on May 14.      While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding  interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as  easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were  badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar  and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.      \"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be  delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one  might see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said.      Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough  economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and  stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.      \"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think  they would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said.      Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased  interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield  Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.      Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an  element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency  policy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off  the yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.      Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked  successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar  within the range of 100 to 103 yen.      Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the  Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a  trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.      Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming  Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other  markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the  weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into  equities, particularly in the gold sector.      The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3  today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while  the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the  same period.      The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese  companies that have invested heavily in the United States in  recent years turning their attention to undervalued real  estate, particularly in the tourism field.      Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star  Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs  as indicative of the type of property being sought.      \"They think they find good value real estate here which,  with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of  investment Australia needs,\" Buttrose added.  "}, {"title": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY", "body": "  Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden  economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices  will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists  say.      Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold  oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the  northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.      Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross  domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year  after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.      This was after taking into account inflation in consumer  prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.      Factors depressing economic activity include the  6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which  threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the  Gulf and has sapped business confidence.      But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September  when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis  caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive  new debt settlement program was introduced.      The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward  trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.      The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer  spending, thus generating an informal credit system.      Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are  still owed by individuals and companies.      There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)  in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which  one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as  bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it  will not allow any banks to go under.      The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of  problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether  debtors have regular cash flows or not.      Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights  guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance  in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector  is the biggest after oil.      Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride  out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.      Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)  compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last  year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.      But strategic diversification into downstream operations in  Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at  home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell  over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.      Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average  2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed  product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as  crude.      Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason  for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic  inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent  years and signs government spending on productive sectors will  remain steady.      External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8  billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below  that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit  Gulf.      Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put  officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income  of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.      But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these  reserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for  the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.      In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,  revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,  doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.      This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded  in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at  up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some  shortfall.      Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for  economic growth this year or next.      \"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer is  important.\"      Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday  the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state  spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the  economy.      He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be  spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.

Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,  unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser  and overstressed palms, they said.      The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World  newsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to  drop sharply this year.      Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about  115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more  palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the  industry, a leading grower told Reuters.      The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes  against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.      The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year  due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.

A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB  from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's  outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on  April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former  chairman of both SMC and UCPB.      Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)  and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.      Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and  represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's  plans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of  fiduciary duties.\"      The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be  held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a  government nominee on the company's board.      De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,  asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by  the company's board.      On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the  sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per  share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained  earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the  purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of  dividends.      De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate  an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt  to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon  del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would  boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.      In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier  suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres  Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.      De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming  last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong  subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.  The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board  meeting.      An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to  resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by  April 15.      \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of  a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard  of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early  disposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in  a statement.      \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have  reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of  payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the  government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement  of the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added.      A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on  Cojuangco's court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from  us might be interpreted as adversarial.\"      Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which  sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible  to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United  States citizen.      The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares,  which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares which  are available to foreign buyers.      SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among  prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by  the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed  institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers  in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.      The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on  Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were  owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President  Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the  U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend  announced last June.      \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaz  told Reuters. \"But everything is on hold now.\"      The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy  would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'  meeting, scheduled for May 14.      San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion  pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in  1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of  700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.

Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better  than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman  said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain  is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.

"}, {"title": "POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL", "body": "  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl  said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation  of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German  economic growth.      In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs  here, Poehl said \"It would be an extremely risky policy to aim  for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to  correct the trade deficit.\"      He said the United States could face a vicious circle of  depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that  route.      Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet  U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,  accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating  above-target money supply growth.      He said he would have been happy to have brought forward  five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to  the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced  political constraints getting such measures through the upper  house of the West German parliament.      But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could  accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.      Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about  one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial  erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing  demand at home.      \"A further appreciation of the mark could even be an  obstacle to further growth,\" he said.      Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply  growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and  because external factors, including low oil prices and  favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.      But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma  over monetary policy.      The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the  reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany  was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.      \"For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more  on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary  money supply. But we must be very careful,\" he said.      He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's  trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as  the United States.      Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary  officials of major industrialized countries, saying the  importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange  rates had been underestimated.      All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the  right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he  said.      \"This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the  part of our American colleagues,\" he said.      But he said there was still a danger that the correction of  the dollar's value could overshoot.

Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,  Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased  the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.      \"We are proposing legislation that would provide for more  disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would  insure that takeovers are properly financed,\" he said.      Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold  for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a  investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a  company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within  10 days, Proxmire said.      In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement  that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have  to filed with the SEC.      Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to  prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in  knowing about coming takeover attempts.      Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a  tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60  business days from the current 20 business days.      His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring  company violated the time period on the tender offer.      To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire  said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin  requirments are properly enforced.      The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement  for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally  enforced in hostile takeovers.      Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover  declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without  actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.      He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for  failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin  requirements.      The bill also would require more disclose when several  investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.      \"When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know  about it,\" Proxmire said.      Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain  towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all  shareholders recieve equal treatment.      He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover  defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.      Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this  month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.      He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this  year.

Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs  of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.      U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop  accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,  but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of \"the high  potential of a continued suspension that would result in  reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.\"      Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are  received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that  full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.

Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness  of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and  Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.      But he declined to say what measures would be discussed  ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later  today.      Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said  the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre  accord, had been underestimated.      Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major  countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual  meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,  marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major  trading partners.      \"There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,\" he  said. \"We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do  not want to discuss that here.      Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a  \"slight firming\" of the yen against the dollar.      And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged  since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell  marks to support the dollar.      \"The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,\" he  said.      Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the  bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be  accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.      Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its  pledges for economic stimulation.      \"And we will have to see if the United States is able to do  what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit --  and get it through Congress,\" he added.      Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further  fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against  the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.      \"You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And  it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem,\" he  said.

They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates  had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which  has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.      However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,  producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain  could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.      Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27  millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in  Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in  Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.      There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.      Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce  rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the  crops, including soybean.      However, as the lands began drying later in the week  harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40  pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.      Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested  material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield  estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.

It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will  begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.      Production estimates for maize were down from last week at  9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated  previously.      This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln  tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and  21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln  tonnes.      Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to  seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.      Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in  Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and  Buenos Aires in mid-April.      The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.      The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2  mln tonne crop.      The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of  7.1 mln.

The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some  areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some  experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on  this were not available.

On an unadjusted basis total unemployment fell by 16,500 in  the month to end-March to 692,200. In March 1986 the figure was  725,000.      A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a  smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year,  because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the  building industry. He said this explained the increase in the  adjusted statistics.      Total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at  end-March. A year earlier the figure was 28,763.

This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an  industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF  Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms  to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.      Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the  Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for  money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.      \"I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,\" said  Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,  \"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world  now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving  the old ones.\"      Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.      U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,  managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand  for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up  by as much as 300 pct, he said.      Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in  Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its  history.      In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.  dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entire  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\"  Oreffice said.      GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.  Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.      The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical  industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and  planning, said Pace's John Dosher.      Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar  was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost  U.S. chemical exports.      Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers  in the early 1980s.      Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate  unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.      GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire  Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs  for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics  and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA>   has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.      But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.      \"Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had  deteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventually  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche  market.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern.      \"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting  carried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF's Heyman  cautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may be  ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\"      Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the  Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.      Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout  of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1  billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants  along the Texas Gulf Coast.      The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that  are the building blocks of specialty products.      \"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a  glamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demand  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.      Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood  and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical  business could last as long as four or five years, provided the  U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.
